# Carry it Forward by Slacker Hackers
Made for "Hack for a Cause" 2019

## Abstract
Carry It Forward Spark is a new program we're implementing to help specific individuals in the community with the items and support they need. Every month Carry It Forward chooses 5 worthy unhoused individuals to tell you their story and what they need to survive and thrive.

You can choose to donate items directly, give money towards their purchase or offer help in other ways. Please read their stories and help in any way you're able.
